			<h2 epub:type="title">The Bit of Candy</h2>
			<p>A little girl had some candy in a piece of paper.</p>
			<p>At first there was much candy, but she ate it till there was only one lump left.</p>
			<p>And she asked herself should she eat this lump also or should she give it to the poor.</p>
			<p>“I’ll give it to a poor girl,” said she.</p>
			<p>But after a while she thought: “Perhaps it would be better to divide the candy in half and share it.” So she ate up half the lump.</p>
			<p>Then she thought about the bit that was left, and she said to herself: “I’ll break that in two again and give half of it to the little girl.”</p>
			<p>At last so little remained of the lump of candy that it wasn’t worth while giving it to the poor girl⁠—so she ate up what was left.</p>
