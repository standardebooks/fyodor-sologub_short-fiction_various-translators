			<h2 epub:type="title">The Independent Leaves</h2>
			<p>Some leaves with very strong stalks were hanging from a branch, and they found life very dull. It was very unpleasant — they could see the birds flying and the kittens running about; even the clouds were being carried along — and they were still on the branch. They swung themselves about, trying to break off from their stalks and be free.</p>
			<p>They said to one another:</p>
			<p>"We can live independent lives. We are quite grown up. But here we are under guardianship, stuck fast to this old stupid branch."</p>
			<p>They swung themselves about and at last got free. They fell to the ground and withered. Presently the gardener came and swept them away with the refuse.</p>
