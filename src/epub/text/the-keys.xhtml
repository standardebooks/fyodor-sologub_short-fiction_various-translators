			<h2 epub:type="title">The Keys</h2>
			<p>A skeleton-key said to her neighbour:</p>
			<p>“I go about everywhere, but you lie still. Where have I not been, but you’ve always remained at home. What are you thinking about?”</p>
			<p>The old key did not want to answer, but she said:</p>
			<p>“There is a strong oaken door. I lock it, and when the time comes I unlock it again.”</p>
			<p>“Well,” said the skeleton-key, “but aren’t there a great many doors in the world?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t need to know about any other doors,” said the key. “I can’t open them.”</p>
			<p>“Can’t you? But I can open every door!”</p>
			<p>And the skeleton-key thought to herself:</p>
			<p>“This key is really stupid if it can only open one door.” But the key said to her:</p>
			<p>“You’re a thieves’ skeleton-key, but I am a true and honest door-key.”</p>
			<p>This the skeleton-key did not understand. She did not know what truth and honesty were, and she thought that the door-key was so old that she had gone out of her mind.</p>
